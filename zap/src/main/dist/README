How to start SHJZapPro
----------------
There are 3 options on Windows:

* Via the desktop icon (assuming you selected this option during installation)
* Via the 'Start' menu:
    All Programs SHJZapPro <version>
* Via the 'zap.bat' command line script in the installation directory 

Linux

On Linux there's just a 'zap.sh' script in the installation directory, although
you can create a desktop icon manually as well.

Mac OS

Generally, most user's tend to use the Mac OS build, which is a ordinary Mac OS
app that can be started as any other app: Double-Click on the app to start it. 
You can use the 'zap.sh' script, as per linux.

Docker

SHJZapPro is available on https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/zap2docker-stable/

Headless Environment
--------------------

By default SHJZapPro will be started with a GUI which is not supported in headless
environments, in those cases ZAP needs to be started inline, using the command
line argument '-cmd', or in daemon mode, using '-daemon'.
For more information about the command line arguments use '-help'.
SHJZapPro will show an information message and exit, if still started with GUI.
